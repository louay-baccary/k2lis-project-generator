# Assets 
Where you find all your external files
# Components
Where you create your simple components
# CoreUI
Where you create components that are vital to the app like the navigation bars,headers,footers ...etc
# Hooks
Where you create your custom hooks
# Layout 
Where you create your layouts
# Store 
We use redux-toolkit 
Inside feature folder you should add all your slices
A slice is where you define the state and the functions that update that state
PS: you can check the doc here (https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start)
PS: you can use rtk-query to consume apis (https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
# Utils 
Where you build your toolbox : where you find the validators,conversion functions ...etc
We already build an errorBoundary util component , you can use it to do better error handling
# tailwind.conf.js
Here you can customize the styling


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
